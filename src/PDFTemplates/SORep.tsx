                    <br />
                    Acceptance
                    The terms of sale contained herein apply to all sales transactions including Quotations and Purchase Orders entered into by
                    Seller directly with the Buyer for standard product. Custom product sales may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
                    This acceptance is conditional upon Buyer's assent to the terms and conditions set out herein in lieu of those in Buyer's
                    purchase orders. Modifications or additions to these terms of sale will be recognized only if accepted in writing by an officer
                    of the Seller. Seller's failure to object to provisions contained in any communication from Buyer shall not be deemed a
                    waiver of the provisions contained herein.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Prices
                    Quotations automatically expire 30 days from the date issued and are subject to withdrawal or extension by notice within
                    that period. Seller's published prices are subject to change without notice. New pricing will not be applied to existing orders
                    accepted by Seller. Prices quoted are for products only and do not include any other charges unless specifically covered in
                    writing by Seller. Any discrepancies relating to price must be called to Seller's attention for resolution within 30 days of the
                    billing date.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Taxes
                    Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing or required by law, all prices will be quoted and billed exclusive of federal, state
                    and local excise sales and similar taxes. Such taxes, when applicable shall appear as additional terms on the invoice. If
                    exemption from such taxes is claimed, buyer must provide, or have on file with Seller, a certificate of exemption at the time
                    the Purchase Order is submitted to Seller.

                    <br />

                    Buyer's Purchase Orders must be in writing and approved by an authorized representative of the Buyer. Seller shall
                    determine order acceptance at its discretion, and may impose restrictions for quantity requirements in regard to total order
                    value and product packaging minimums. Seller can also restrict time frames for scheduled deliveries and change order
                    activity. Terms of acceptance will be mutually understood by both parties, and authorized in writing by Seller at the Buyer's
                    request.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Terms of Payment
                    The Seller reserves the right to require payment in advance or C.O.D. and otherwise modify credit terms. Unless otherwise
                    agreed, partial shipments can be made and payment shall become due in accordance with the designated terms upon
                    submission of invoices. Each shipment shall be invoiced separately and Buyer shall pay for each shipment as invoiced. If
                    shipments are delayed by Buyer without Seller's prior written consent, payments shall become due on the date when Seller
                    is prepared to make shipment. Products held for the Buyer by the Seller shall be at the risk and expense of the Buyer. Seller
                    reserves the right to add a monthly service charge as allowed by law.

                    be collect, or if prepaid, will be subsequently billed to the Buyer. Title shall pass to the Buyer, and Seller's liability as to
                    delivery shall cease on delivery of products to carrier at Seller's facility, regardless of any provisions for payment of freight
                    or insurance or the form of shipping documents. Risk of loss or damage in transit shall rest with the Buyer. All claims for
                    loss or damage will be filed with the carrier. Claims against Seller for shortages occurring before delivery to carrier shall be
                    waived unless made within thirty (30) days after delivery of shipment to the Buyer.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Contingencies
                    All shipping dates and quantities are approximate. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to fill all orders according to the
                    agreed upon schedule and quantity. Seller shall not be responsible for any failure to perform resulting from unforeseen
                    circumstances or causes beyond Seller's reasonable control. Such causes include, but are not limited to; strikes, floods,
                    fires, labor disputes, accidents, inability to maintain materials or supplies, excessive demand for products over the available
                    supply, custom duties or surcharges, and interruption for any reason in the manufacture of Seller's products by Seller's
                    suppliers, any act of God, or the action of any government. In the event of any delay caused by such a contingency, the date
                    of delivery shall, at the request of the Seller be deferred for period equal to the period of delay.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Patents
                    Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless against all expenses, damages, costs, or losses resulting from any
                    suit or proceeding brought for infringement of copyright, patent, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights or for
                    unfair competition arising from compliance with Buyer's design specifications or instructions. With respect to products
                    manufactured solely to Seller's design and specifications, Seller shall defend any suit or proceeding brought against Buyer
                    so far as based on a claim that any such products of any parts there of furnished hereunder constitute an infringement of
                    any United States patent or United States mask work rights, if notified promptly of such claim in writing and given
                    authority, information and assistance in the defense of same, and Seller shall pay all damages and costs awarded therein

                    infringement of patent claims covering completed equipment or any assembly, circuit, combination, method or process in
                    which any products may be used. In no event shall Seller's total liability to Buyer under or as a result of compliance with
                    provisions of this paragraph exceed the aggregate sum paid to Seller by Buyer for the purchase of allegedly infringing
                    products or parts. The foregoing states the entire warranty by Seller and the exclusive remedy of the Buyer with respect to
                    any alleged copyright, patent or other intellectual property right infringement by such products or parts. No costs or
                    expenses under this paragraph shall in any event be incurred for the account of the Seller without its prior written consent.
                    Sale of product or any part thereof does not convey to Buyer any license, express or by implication, estoppels or otherwise,
                    under any patent claim with respect to which Seller can grant licenses covering complicated equipment, or any assembly,
                    circuit, combination, method or process in which any such products are used as components (not withstanding) the fact
                    that such products may have been designed for use in or may only be useful in any such patented equipment, assembly
                    circuit, combination, method or process, and that such products may have been purchased and sold for such use). Seller
                    expressly reserves all rights under such patent or patent claim.

                    conditions:
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    A. If products become defective during the warranty period, Buyer shall notify Seller promptly in writing of any such claims
                    and provide information pertinent to delivery dates of the product and/or date code information.

                    the batteries.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    under warranty, or (ii) determined not to be defective, or (iii) defective due to any cause not covered under the warranty
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <br />

                    E. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for shipping charges to the extent of the percent of the total return that are found by Seller
                    to be defective as specified herein. Reimbursement will be in the form of a credit adjustment to Buyer's account unless
                    otherwise agreed upon.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    F. In no event shall Seller be liable for any defective products if examination discloses that the defective condition of such

                    Seller, alteration, accident or negligence in use, storage, transportation or handling outside of specified environmental
                    conditions.

                    G. Seller assumes no risk or liability for the suitability or unsuitability or results of its products, used in combination with
                    any electrical or electronic components, circuits, systems, assemblies, or any other material substances, or environments.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    H. Any returned products electrically or mechanically destroyed by Buyer or third parties will not be covered under this
                    warranty, and will not be returned to Buyer, but will be scrapped by Seller.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I. This warranty shall exist for a period of twelve (12) months after the date of shipment from the Seller and is considered
                    null and void if components or subassemblies other than those supplied or approved by Seller are used in the assembly of
                    Sellerâ€™s products, or if Sellers product is modified in any way without written authorization of Seller.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    J. Developmental products of Seller are warranted to be free from defects in materials and workmanship and to meet the
                    applicable specifications only at the time of receipt of Buyer and for no longer period of time. All accepted deliveries are
                    deemed to be free from defects as of the time of delivery.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    K. Product sold but not manufactured by the Seller will be warranted as to defects in material and workmanship consistent
                    with the warranty policy of the original manufacturer of the product. The Seller's only obligation shall be to assign Buyer, to
                    the extent possible, whatever warranty the Seller receives from said manufacturer. In no event shall the Seller be liable for
                    loss, damage or expense directly or indirectly arising from the use of the units or from any other cause, except as expressly
                    stated in this warranty. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES, WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE DESCRIPTION ON THE FACE HEREOF.
                    THE SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OF THE GOODS OR OF THE FITNESS OF THE
                    GOODS FOR ANY INTENDED PURPOSE. The Seller is not liable for, and the Buyer waives any right of action it has or may
                    have against the Seller for any consequential or special damages arising out of any breach of warranty and for any damages
                    the Buyer may claim for damage to any property or injury or death to any person arising out of its purchase or the use,
                    operation, or maintenance of the product. The Seller will not be liable for any labor subcontracted or performed by the
                    Buyer for preparation of item under warranty for return to the Sellerâ€™s factory or for preparation work for field repair or
                    replacement. Invoicing of the Seller for labor either performed or subcontracted by the Buyer will not be considered as a
                    liability by the Seller. The Seller's obligations under this warranty are conditioned upon timely receipt of all payments in
                    strict accordance with payment terms, time being of the essence in this regard. During the time while the Seller has not
                    received any amount overdue, the Seller shall have no obligation under this warranty. The expiration date of the warranty
                    shall not be extended upon payment of the overdue amount.
                    <br />

                    months of the date of such acknowledgement.
