                <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</h3>
                <h5>Acceptance</h5>
                <div>
                    The terms of sale contained herein apply to all sales transactions including Quotations and Purchase
                    Orders entered into by Seller directly with the Buyer for standard product. Custom product sales may
                    be subject to additional terms and conditions. This acceptance is conditional upon Buyer's assent to
                    the terms and conditions set out herein in lieu of those in Buyer's purchase orders. Modifications
                    or additions to these terms of sale will be recognized only if accepted in writing by an officer of
                    the Seller. Seller's failure to object to provisions contained in any communication from Buyer shall
                    not be deemed a waiver of the provisions contained herein.
                </div>

                <h5>Prices</h5>
                <div>
                    Quotations automatically expire 30 days from the date issued and are subject to withdrawal or
                    extension by notice within that period. Seller's published prices are subject to change without
                    notice. New pricing will not be applied to existing orders accepted by Seller. Prices quoted are for
                    products only and do not include any other charges unless specifically covered in writing by Seller.

                <div>
                    Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing or required by law, all prices will be quoted and billed
                    exclusive of federal, state and local excise sales and similar taxes. Such taxes, when applicable
                    shall appear as additional terms on the invoice. If exemption from such taxes is claimed, buyer must
                    provide, or have on file with Seller, a certificate of exemption at the time the Purchase Order is
                    submitted to Seller.

                    Buyer. Seller shall determine order acceptance at its discretion, and may impose restrictions for
                    quantity requirements in regard to total order value and product packaging minimums. Seller can also
                    restrict time frames for scheduled deliveries and change order activity. Terms of acceptance will be
                    mutually understood by both parties, and authorized in writing by Seller at the Buyer's request.
                </div>
                <h5>Terms of Payment</h5>
                <div>
                    The Seller reserves the right to require payment in advance or C.O.D. and otherwise modify credit

                    accordance with the designated terms upon submission of invoices. Each shipment shall be invoiced
                    separately and Buyer shall pay for each shipment as invoiced. If shipments are delayed by Buyer
                    without Seller's prior written consent, payments shall become due on the date when Seller is
                    prepared to make shipment. Products held for the Buyer by the Seller shall be at the risk and
                    expense of the Buyer. Seller reserves the right to add a monthly service charge as allowed by law.
                </div>

                    shall pass to the Buyer, and Seller's liability as to delivery shall cease on delivery of products
                    to carrier at Seller's facility, regardless of any provisions for payment of freight or insurance or
                    the form of shipping documents. Risk of loss or damage in transit shall rest with the Buyer. All
                    claims for loss or damage will be filed with the carrier. Claims against Seller for shortages
                    occurring before delivery to carrier shall be waived unless made within thirty (30) days after
                    delivery of shipment to the Buyer.
                </div>
                <h5>Contingencies</h5>
                <div>
                    All shipping dates and quantities are approximate. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to fill all
                    orders according to the agreed upon schedule and quantity. Seller shall not be responsible for any
                    failure to perform resulting from unforeseen circumstances or causes beyond Seller's reasonable
                    control. Such causes include, but are not limited to; strikes, floods, fires, labor disputes,
                    accidents, inability to maintain materials or supplies, excessive demand for products over the
                    available supply, custom duties or surcharges, and interruption for any reason in the manufacture of
                    Seller's products by Seller's suppliers, any act of God, or the action of any government. In the
                    event of any delay caused by such a contingency, the date of delivery shall, at the request of the
                    Seller be deferred for period equal to the period of delay.
                </div>
                <h5>Patents</h5>
                <div>
                    Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless against all expenses, damages, costs, or
                    losses resulting from any suit or proceeding brought for infringement of copyright, patent,
                    trademarks, or other intellectual property rights or for unfair competition arising from compliance
                    with Buyer's design specifications or instructions. With respect to products manufactured solely to
                    Seller's design and specifications, Seller shall defend any suit or proceeding brought against Buyer
                    so far as based on a claim that any such products of any parts there of furnished hereunder
                    constitute an infringement of any United States patent or United States mask work rights, if
                    notified promptly of such claim in writing and given authority, information and assistance in the
                    defense of same, and Seller shall pay all damages and costs awarded therein against Buyer. Seller
                    assumes no liability, consequential or otherwise for, and Buyer agrees to hold Seller harmless
                    against infringement of patent claims covering completed equipment or any assembly, circuit,
                    combination, method or process in which any products may be used. In no event shall Seller's total
                    liability to Buyer under or as a result of compliance with provisions of this paragraph exceed the
                    aggregate sum paid to Seller by Buyer for the purchase of allegedly infringing products or parts.
                    The foregoing states the entire warranty by Seller and the exclusive remedy of the Buyer with
                    respect to any alleged copyright, patent or other intellectual property right infringement by such
                    products or parts. No costs or expenses under this paragraph shall in any event be incurred for the
                    account of the Seller without its prior written consent. Sale of product or any part thereof does
                    not convey to Buyer any license, express or by implication, estoppels or otherwise, under any patent
                    claim with respect to which Seller can grant licenses covering complicated equipment, or any
                    assembly, circuit, combination, method or process in which any such products are used as components
                    (not withstanding) the fact that such products may have been designed for use in or may only be
                    useful in any such patented equipment, assembly circuit, combination, method or process, and that
                    such products may have been purchased and sold for such use). Seller expressly reserves all rights
                    under such patent or patent claim.
                </div>
                <h5>Warranty and Sole Remedy</h5>
                <div>
                    For the applicable warranty period specified below, Seller warrants that the products to be
                    delivered hereunder will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and
                    service. The obligations of the Seller under this warranty are limited to replacing, repairing or
                    giving credit for, at its option, any of said products which shall, within the warranty period be
                    returned as provided herein to the Seller, transportation charges prepaid and which are, after
                    examination, disclosed to the satisfaction of the Seller to be thus defective. Buyer acknowledges
                    and agrees that the provisions of this warranty constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available
                    to it with regard to said defective products. No agent, employee, or representative of Seller has
                    any authority to bind Seller to any affirmation, representation or warranty relating to the products
                    other than as specifically provided herein. The warranty provided herein is subject to the following
                    conditions:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A. If products become defective during the warranty period, Buyer shall notify Seller promptly in
                    writing of any such claims and provide information pertinent to delivery dates of the product and/or
                    date code information.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    B. If Seller advises Buyer to return the product for repair or replacement, Buyer will follow
                    Sellers Material Return Authorization procedures. Any order returned after 90 days from the time the
                    order arrived on site, will not get credit for the batteries.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    C. If product alleged by Buyer to be defective or returned to Seller for repair as provided in this
                    section is either (I) not under warranty, or (ii) determined not to be defective, or (iii) defective
                    due to any cause not covered under the warranty provided herein, Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
                    for all reasonable expenses incurred in traveling and/or shipping, handling, and inspection of such
                    product.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    D. Products will be accepted by Seller for warranty claim verification only when returned by Buyer
                    in a condition which allows for suitable testing by Seller.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    E. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for shipping charges to the extent of the percent of the total
                    return that are found by Seller to be defective as specified herein. Reimbursement will be in the
                    form of a credit adjustment to Buyer's account unless otherwise agreed upon.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    F. In no event shall Seller be liable for any defective products if examination discloses that the
                    defective condition of such products was caused by misuse, abuse or improper installation,
                    application, maintenance or repair assembly by other than Seller, alteration, accident or negligence
                    in use, storage, transportation or handling outside of specified environmental conditions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    G. Seller assumes no risk or liability for the suitability or unsuitability or results of its
                    products, used in combination with any electrical or electronic components, circuits, systems,
                    assemblies, or any other material substances, or environments.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    H. Any returned products electrically or mechanically destroyed by Buyer or third parties will not
                    be covered under this warranty, and will not be returned to Buyer, but will be scrapped by Seller.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I. This warranty shall exist for a period of twelve (12) months after the date of shipment from the
                    Seller and is considered null and void if components or subassemblies other than those supplied or
                    approved by Seller are used in the assembly of Sellerâ€™s products, or if Sellers product is modified
                    in any way without written authorization of Seller.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    J. Developmental products of Seller are warranted to be free from defects in materials and
                    workmanship and to meet the applicable specifications only at the time of receipt of Buyer and for
                    no longer period of time. All accepted deliveries are deemed to be free from defects as of the time
                    of delivery.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    K. Product sold but not manufactured by the Seller will be warranted as to defects in material and
                    workmanship consistent with the warranty policy of the original manufacturer of the product. The
                    Seller's only obligation shall be to assign Buyer, to the extent possible, whatever warranty the
                    Seller receives from said manufacturer. In no event shall the Seller be liable for loss, damage or
                    expense directly or indirectly arising from the use of the units or from any other cause, except as
                    expressly stated in this warranty. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES, WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE DESCRIPTION ON
                    THE FACE HEREOF. THE SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OF THE GOODS OR OF THE
                    FITNESS OF THE GOODS FOR ANY INTENDED PURPOSE. The Seller is not liable for, and the Buyer waives
                    any right of action it has or may have against the Seller for any consequential or special damages
                    arising out of any breach of warranty and for any damages the Buyer may claim for damage to any
                    property or injury or death to any person arising out of its purchase or the use, operation, or
                    maintenance of the product. The Seller will not be liable for any labor subcontracted or performed
                    by the Buyer for preparation of item under warranty for return to the Sellerâ€™s factory or for
                    preparation work for field repair or replacement. Invoicing of the Seller for labor either performed
                    or subcontracted by the Buyer will not be considered as a liability by the Seller. The Seller's
                    obligations under this warranty are conditioned upon timely receipt of all payments in strict
                    accordance with payment terms, time being of the essence in this regard. During the time while the
                    Seller has not received any amount overdue, the Seller shall have no obligation under this warranty.
                    The expiration date of the warranty shall not be extended upon payment of the overdue amount.

                    upon by the parties prior to the arbitration. To the extent that Buyer and Seller cannot agree on
                    the rules of the arbitration, the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association shall

                    <br />
                    A. The arbitration shall be held by a single arbitrator mutually acceptable to both parties. If the
                    parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, each party shall identify one independent individual
                    who shall meet to appoint a single arbitrator.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    B. The decision of the arbitrator shall be considered as a final and binding resolution of the
                    disagreement which may be entered as a judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    C. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles County, California.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    D. Neither party shall sue the other except for enforcement of the arbitrator's decision. All
                    disagreements or controversies of any kind whether claimed in tort, contract or otherwise, either
                    concerning this agreement or any other matter whatsoever, shall be arbitrated according to the
